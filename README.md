# On-Close-and-Distant-Reading-in-Digital-Humanities
mini project in python, about : On Close and Distant Reading in Digital Humanities

Abstract
"We present an overview of the last ten years of research on visualizations that support close and distant reading of
textual data in the digital humanities. We look at various works published within both the visualization and digital
humanities communities. We provide a taxonomy of applied methods for close and distant reading, and illustrate
approaches that combine both reading techniques to provide a multifaceted view of the data. Furthermore, we
list toolkits and potentially beneficial visualization approaches for research in the digital humanities. Finally, we
summarize collaboration experiences when developing visualizations for close and distant reading, and give an
outlook on future challenges in that research area.
